In this project, we focus on developing a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions within credit card data. Credit card fraud poses a significant challenge to financial institutions and consumers globally, with traditional rule-based detection systems often struggling to adapt to new fraud tactics. 
Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle. It consists of credit card transactions from September 2013, featuring both fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with a majority of transactions being non-fraudulent and a small fraction being fraudulent.
Approach

    Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
        Explore the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
        Perform data cleaning, handle missing values, and conduct feature engineering to prepare the data for modeling.

    Model Selection and Training:
        Experiment with various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machines.
        Train these models on the preprocessed data and evaluate their performance using relevant metrics.

    Evaluation and Tuning:
        Assess model performance with metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix.
        Fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize model performance and improve detection accuracy.

Tools and Libraries

    Python
    scikit-learn
    numpy
    pandas
    matplotlib
    seaborn

This project aims to enhance the effectiveness of credit card fraud detection systems by utilizing machine learning to better adapt to evolving fraud strategies.
